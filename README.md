# YouTube-8M Tensorflow Starter Code

This provides a solution to the [3rd Youtube8M Video Understanding Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/youtube8m-2019/overview), using the [YouTube-8M](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/) dataset. This was inspired by the NetFV shown here (https://github.com/miha-skalic/youtube8mchallenge) and NeXtVLAD here (https://github.com/linrongc/youtube-8m).

# No Results?

While I don't have training and testing results, given that I don't own a good enough GPU, I hope that someone with enough compute capacity will be able to provide possible results for this solution. Fisher vectors are generally very compute intensive compared to VLADs.
